This is the github folder for Project 2. Project 2 entailed creating a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design of Project 1. My PCB included an LCD display, four buttons, a USB jack for audio input, and cable inputs for the two IR sensors. The board has four layers with two power polygons, and one ground layer. The buttons are placed such that the record and history buttons are side by side at the bottom of the board while the history scroll buttons are stacked on top of each other at the far right side ofthe board.

The functionality of the board is as follows:

It is a device that measures the speed at which a golf ball approaches the hole. It will be positioned directly in front of the cup, slightly offset from the line of the putt. Used on flat putting surfaces to help with speed/distance control.

The device will provide visual and audible feedback. The ball speed will be visible on a small display screen, and a speaker will inform the user of the quality of the putt based on its speed:

Slow speeds: ”Too slow!”
Fast speeds: “Too fast!”
Perfect speed: “Perfect putt!”

The device will utilize IR sensors, a screen display, a speaker, buttons, and the Pocket Beagle to achieve this functionality.

The screen will display a history of the speeds of the recorded putts, and two buttons will be used to scroll up and down the list of putt speeds. All speeds are in cm/s.
