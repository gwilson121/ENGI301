This is the github folder for Project 2. Project 2 entailed creating a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design of Project 1. My PCB included an LCD display, four buttons, a USB jack, and cable inputs for the two IR sensors. The board has four layers with two power polygons, and one ground layer. The buttons are placed such that the record and history buttons are side by side at the bottom of the board while the history scroll buttons are stacked on top of each other at the far right side ofthe board.
